                                                <p>Kapil Gupta truly believes that everyone can be happy in their current circumstances and everyone has the power to change their life. With this in mind, Kapil has been passionately exploring the mental wellness space and is the key brain behind Solh. A marketeer to the core, Kapil Gupta is an entrepreneur, both in thought and in style who believes that the power of a message & its delivery is what causes true revolutions. He has used this in his professional endeavors as well as his social evangelism activities. He is a parallel entrepreneur who believes in providing true meaning to the various organizations he runs and builds them in sync with one another. He jokingly calls himself the jack of all trades and a master of some. He truly believes that happiness is self-generated, not ambiance acquired, and certainly not situation dependent. A simple man with a simpler living and clarity of thought, the luxuries of his corporate success do not restrict him from delving deeper into the causes and tonality of our social construct. Trying to understand these nuances is fundamental to all his businesses. Though he does not believe in the socialist principles of forceful equality, he dreams of uplifting the disadvantaged through creating a wider scope of prosperity.</p>

In the same context, he passionately believes that all health insurance policies must include the treatment of mental health issues, which is currently not the case. Insurance policies seem to be very indifferent towards mental health, and skin and eye treatments. He believes that once the government supports and covers everything around Mental Health requirements, the country can really grow at a fast pace while matching the global economy.</p>

                                                    <p>A third-generation publisher, Pranav grew Prints Publications multi-fold not just in revenue but also in reputation and global markets. Pranav takes pride in being one of the limited publishers who’ve not used the power of digital & tech but created multiple brands around it.</p>
                                                    <p>He believes that the needs of India, global exposure, changing education dynamics and the unlimited powers of digital are some of the key tenets which need to be sewn together before we foray into a new decade. Which is why he deem his candidature/nomination for IPA as one of the most pivotal opportunities that can shape the future of publishing, education digitisation across industries.</p>

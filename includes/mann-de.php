                                    <p>While De-Mann wants to be as chirpy and cool as Mann, his inner inhibitions which have been instigated by several negative life experiences restricts him. He is fearful of tomorrow and highly pessimistic, because he does not want to be hurt again.</p>
                                    <p>Mann radiates a positive energy, yet he never lets go of his friend. He understands where De-Mann â€™s negative experiences are coming from and is always all ears to anything he has to say.</p>
                                    <p>Together they can cross the horizon aiming towards a new dawn, be best friends!</p>
